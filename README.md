# ðŸ—‚ FlashCards 

### Summary
Test your fundamental knowledge of JavaScript by playing this flashcard game in the comfort of your own terminal. 

After installing and starting the game (by following the below instructions in the Install/Setup section) the user will be prompeted with a question and a few possible answers to choose from. The user can select the answer by either entering the number that corresponds to the answer option, or by using the arrow keys to move up/down and hitting enter. Upong choosing an answer, the program will let the user know if their choice was 'correct' or 'incorrect'. Entering again will move the user to the next question.

After the user has gone through all 30 cards, a message will be displayed with the percent total questions answered correctly. To exit the game early, the user can quit the game by hitting `control + C`.
